Rust Orderbook Engine

A high-performance matching engine, limit order book, market maker, and simulator written in Rust, built for low-latency electronic trading systems.

üßë‚Äçüéì Learning Outcomes

	‚Ä¢	Rust mastery: ownership/borrowing, async/await with Tokio, synchronization (Mutex, watch channel).

	‚Ä¢	Systems design: architecting a modular engine, REST+WebSocket APIs with Axum.

	‚Ä¢	Database integration: schema migrations and persistence using SQLx+Postgres.

	‚Ä¢	Trading concepts: limit vs market orders, price-time priority matching, two-sided quoting market making.
      
	‚Ä¢	Performance benchmarking: using Criterion to measure matching engine throughput and latency.

‚ö° Features
	‚Ä¢	Order Matching Engine
	‚Ä¢	Price-time priority with FIFO queues per price level.
	‚Ä¢	Supports limit and market orders, partial fills, crossing orders.
	‚Ä¢	REST & WebSocket API (Axum)
	‚Ä¢	POST /orders to create orders, DELETE /orders/{id} to cancel.
	‚Ä¢	GET /book and live WsFrame::BookSnapshot updates.
	‚Ä¢	GET /trades and live WsFrame::Trade feeds.
	‚Ä¢	Market Maker Bot
	‚Ä¢	Two-sided quoting around mid-price with adjustable spread & cadence.
	‚Ä¢	Reacts to book snapshots over WebSocket and cancels/reposts quotes.
	‚Ä¢	Simulator & P&L
	‚Ä¢	Simulates aggressive market orders against the engine to measure realized P&L and inventory.
	‚Ä¢	Persistence
	‚Ä¢	Persists all trade events to Postgres via SQLx migrations.
	‚Ä¢	Benchmark Suite
	‚Ä¢	Criterion benchmarks for matching engine under various book depths.

üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites
	‚Ä¢	Rust (1.66+)
	‚Ä¢	Docker & Docker Compose
	‚Ä¢	cargo, docker-compose, psql

Clone & Build

git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
cd order_book-engine
cargo build --release

Database & Migrations
	1.	Launch Postgres via Docker:





docker-compose up -d

2. Create `.env` with:

   ```ini
DATABASE_URL=postgres://trader:secret@localhost:5432/orderbook

	3.	Run migrations (automatically on startup):
SQLx discovers ./migrations/ and applies:





cargo run

### Run Service + Market Maker + Simulator

```bash
cargo run --release

This will:
	1.	Start HTTP+WS server on localhost:3000.
	2.	Seed initial book levels in main.rs (48 bid / 52 ask).
	3.	Spawn the Market Maker to quote at [mid-2, mid+2] every 500ms.
	4.	Spawn the Simulator issuing random market orders (5 Hz) for 10s.

Logs will display matching events, P&L summary at simulation end.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Modules
	‚Ä¢	orderbook.rs: core BTreeMap+VecDeque book, matching logic match_incoming_side().
	‚Ä¢	api.rs: Axum routes (/orders, /book, /trades, /ws).
	‚Ä¢	market_maker.rs: two-sided quoting bot using WebSocket & REST.
	‚Ä¢	simulate.rs: random market order injector, computes realized P&L.
	‚Ä¢	state.rs: AppState holds in-memory book, channels, and PgPool.
	‚Ä¢	trade.rs & orders.rs: domain structs.

‚∏ª

üìä Benchmarking

cargo bench

Runs Criterion benchmarks under benches/benchmark.rs, measuring matching times for:
	‚Ä¢	Single market order fill across many price levels.
	‚Ä¢	Single crossing limit order.

Sample output:

match 1 market order    time:   [26.5 ns 26.7 ns ...]
match 1 limit crossing  time:   [37.8 ns 38.0 ns ...]


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Next Steps
	‚Ä¢	Expose metrics (Prometheus) for latencies & P&L.
	‚Ä¢	Add order book persistence / recovery from DB.
	‚Ä¢	Advanced market making strategies (inventory skew, dynamic spread).
	‚Ä¢	Web UI (React) for live book and trades visualization.
