Rust Orderbook Engine

An basic implementation of an orderbook engine for educational purposes.

üßë‚Äçüéì Learning Outcomes

	‚Ä¢	Rust mastery: ownership/borrowing, async/await with Tokio, synchronization (Mutex, watch channel).

	‚Ä¢	Systems design: architecting a modular engine, REST+WebSocket APIs with Axum.

	‚Ä¢	Database integration: schema migrations and persistence using SQLx+Postgres.

	‚Ä¢	Trading concepts: limit vs market orders, price-time priority matching, two-sided quoting market making.

	‚Ä¢	Performance benchmarking: using Criterion to measure matching engine throughput and latency.

‚∏ª

‚ö° Features
	‚Ä¢	Order Matching Engine.

	‚Ä¢	Price-time priority with FIFO queues per price level.

	‚Ä¢	Supports limit and market orders, partial fills, crossing orders.

	‚Ä¢	REST & WebSocket API (Axum).

	‚Ä¢	POST /orders to create orders, DELETE /orders/{id} to cancel.

	‚Ä¢	GET /book and live WsFrame::BookSnapshot updates.

	‚Ä¢	GET /trades and live WsFrame::Trade feeds.

	‚Ä¢	Market Maker Bot.

	‚Ä¢	Two-sided quoting around mid-price with adjustable spread & cadence.

	‚Ä¢	Reacts to book snapshots over WebSocket and cancels/reposts quotes.

	‚Ä¢	Simulator & P&L.

	‚Ä¢	Simulates aggressive market orders against the engine to measure realized P&L and inventory.

	‚Ä¢	Persistence.

	‚Ä¢	Persists all trade events to Postgres via SQLx migrations.

	‚Ä¢	Benchmark Suite

	‚Ä¢	Criterion benchmarks for matching engine under various book depths.
